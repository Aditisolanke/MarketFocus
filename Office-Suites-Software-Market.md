At the same time, Google Workspace (formerly G Suite) gained traction, especially in collaborative environments and small to medium-sized businesses.</p><ul> <li><strong>Growth in Cloud Solutions:</strong> The cloud shift led to increased accessibility, enabling users to collaborate in real-time from anywhere.
